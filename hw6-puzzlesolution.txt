Solutions:
puzzle_key = 485066843
puzzle_misspell = "wkitpng"

These were obtained using:
- a custom MD5 brute-force key search
- dictionary-based decoding
- comparison against the correctly identified source text
- and an edit-distance misspelling search (proof-of-work)

To find the 9-digit key, I used a brute-forcer to search for the key; The code tested keys from 000000000 to 999999999, and for each candidate key computed: MD5(key + common_word).
I used ~100 very common English words (e.g. “the”, “and”, “to”, etc.) to check whether any generated hash appeared in PUZZLE.txt. A match was found in about 2 hours:
key = 485066843
matching word = "the"
matching hash = cdf6a5538f463348ace7efaaa8312eba

Then, to decode the message, I combined the macOS dictionary at /usr/share/dict/words to an additional wordlist.txt from online (along with punctuation/capitalization variants). For each candidate word, I computed: MD5(key + word) and and inserted it into a dictionary mapping hash to word. 
PUZZLE.txt was decoded in ORDER such that if the hash existed in the lookup ->  decoded word otherwise would return <?>. This produced an almost complete paragraph with several <?> gaps that represented words missing from the dictionary or possibly the misspelling. The semi-decoded text was enough to recognize the quotation, so I searched online and identified the exact passage as coming from James by Percival Everett. I copied the full original paragraph into a file original.txt so my script could compare it word-by-word against the puzzle.
I compared each original word against the puzzle by computing MD5(key + original_word[i]) and and checking whether it matched the corresponding hash in PUZZLE.txt.All words matched correctly except one: 
Index: 73
Puzzle hash: 9291c4d7338648be9c05d86fdb4124f9
Original word: "waiting"
This indicated that the puzzle text did not use the correct word “waiting” at that position — this was the single incorrect/misspelled word we were asked to detect. The puzzle’s incorrect word must be some string x such that MD5( "485066843" + x ) = the respective hash. To find it, I generated all words within edit distance 1 and 2 of the correct word "waiting" only one matched the puzzle hash which was "wkitpng", hence, the misspelled form.
