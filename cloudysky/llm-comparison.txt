My written model and the robot-generated model both share the same core entities (Posts, Comments, ModerationReason, Avatar/Media) and both attach moderation metadata to content. The AI model added some small touches that I didn't think to add , like explicit hide() methods on Post/Comment, consistent related_names, and a CheckConstraint to enforce that each Media row attaches to exactly one of a post or a comment. It also included an is_active flag on avatars, which would make swapping profile pictures easy. I do feel that my model is more straightforward in interpretability and role semantics, because I have explicit labels for hidden_by, hidden_at, and hidden_reason on both Posts and Comments (the robot does as well), and I use a UserProfile with a clear role field (“serf”/“admin”) to satisfy the UserType requirement. The structure of my written model feels more succinct and favors simpler/explicit fields such that the schema is easier to interpret. I was also trying to pertain to the grading requirements whereas the AI was more free-flowing in its approach.
